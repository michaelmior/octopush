* Octopush protocol specification

** HTTP auth API

*** User auth
    Auth works by relaying the clients cookies to the auth backend with a HTTP GET request.
    A successful auth is indicated by HTTP status code 200 and the user id as response body
    Any other status code is treated as a failure

*** Private channel auth
    Private channels are authed much in the same way as User auth except for that the GET-request has a GET param called chan which is the name of the channel
    Status code 200 is is treated as OK and any other code is treated as a failure and no response body is needed.

** Socketio API
   This is the internal API that the javascript client is built upon

*** Generic errors
    Generic errors are sent with event "error" and error message as data

*** Auth errors
    Auth status codes are sent with event "auth" and one of the following codes
|-----+--------------------------------|
| key | value                          |
|-----+--------------------------------|
|   0 | Auth success                   |
|   1 | Auth failure                   |
|   2 | Server not configured for auth |
|-----+--------------------------------|

*** Public/authed/private channels
    There are three types of channels in Octopush: public, authed and private
    Public channels can be joined without any auth
    Authed channels can only be joined by an authed user
    Private channels are authed with the HTTP auth API
    
    Authed channel names begin with a #, private channels begin with an ! and public channels begin with any other ascii-character

*** Channel join
    Channels are joined by emitting an event "join" with a javascript object with the following structure:
: {
:     chan: "channel-name",
:     cookie: document.cookie
: }
    Cookie is only needed for private channels

*** Channel part
    Channels are parted by emitting an event "part" with the channel name as payload

*** Channel states
    Every time a channel is joined or parted an event "chans" is emitted with the current channel subscriptions
    This is for re-joining all channels when a connection is re-established after a failure
